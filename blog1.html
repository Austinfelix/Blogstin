        <p>I was as usual watching TV-shows and procrastinating
           until it hit me that I do not have any idea what am
           I going to make of myself in the future?<br>
           I kept wandering into my thoughts after hearing
             all the podcasts that were rumored to help me find
             my passion in life, couldn't find anything.
             So I went up to my mother and asked her,
             what she felt is the most suitable career for me?<br><br>
           Oh I forgot to tell you, I am 18 years old by
               the way</p>

           <p> I am currently studying Hotel Management
               in Chennai.<br> So anyways my Mother was really not expressive
               about the question I asked her but she directly gave me an
               answer right in split seconds and she said that, "I always
               wanted you to become a DOCTOR!".<br>
               Now that's a buzzkill because:-<br>
                A. I have no interest in becoming a doctor.<br>
                B. I am not that smart enough.<br></p>

              <p>
                So still my problem wasn't solved yet, I was trying everything in my power to find my passion, then after watching several different movies and TV shows I went on YouTube to look on the ways to find your passion?<br>
                For some reason everyone kept recommending different books to read , So I went to a place where they won't recommend books and that place is called TED-X.
                There was this smart guy who kept talking about asking ourselves 3 questions which if we answer will lead us to finding our passion, those 3 questions were:-

                1. What are you good at?(Obviously)
                2. What excites you in life?
                3. What is it that you could do to help society in a big way?

                To be honest, even after answering those questions I couldn't find my passion for real so I kept looking, again and again until the time I just got really tired and slept off.</p>

               <p>Anyhow I still continued watching a lot of movies until
              I saw this one particular movie on Netflix called "The Social Network"
               directed by David Fincher, turns out watching Mark Zuckerberg coding
               in the movie made me want to code too.<br>So I immediately stopped watching the movie and started doing some research and started learning how to code using some free online tools like codecademy, youtube, google and some E-books.

            Its been at least a week since I have started coding and I started learning HTML and now I have completely finished learning it and currently moving on to learning CSS now.

            Now I have a goal in my mind to learn web development and earn money through freelancing to buy myself a Mac book Air.

            Sounds like a big goal for a 18 year old stuck at home during quarantine, I hope to accomplish it! Someday.

            Until then Ta-ta!<p/>
